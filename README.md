## Proposal 3 - Online Shop

It is intended to develop an information system with a web interface to support an online store. There are two types of users, system administrators and the buyers who register on the system. The system must keep information about the various products, including comments and rating made by users. Buyers can keep lists of favourite products and the system must maintain a history of all previous purchases.
